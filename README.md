# Text Generator
This code allows you to generate more or less readable texts based on text sources using Marcov's chains of order 2.

1. Prepare a directory with texts (~100 Mb in the same style).
2. Create a corpus from your sources (using corpus.py).
3. Generate text from created corpus (using text_generator.py).
